# PyTorch Tutorial
Welcome to the PyTorch Tutorial repository! This repository contains a collection of tutorials and code examples to help you learn and understand PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework.

## Introduction
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It provides a flexible and dynamic computational graph, allowing for easy experimentation and efficient deployment of deep learning models. This tutorial repository is designed to guide beginners through the basics of PyTorch and help them build a strong foundation in deep learning concepts and practices.

### Official Documentation
Refer to the official [PyTorch Documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html).

### Datasets


## Pytorch VS Tensorflow
They are the two most popular deep learning libraries within the machine learning community. Both PyTorch and TensorFlow are powerful frameworks with their own strengths and weaknesses. The choice between them often depends on factors such as ease of use, deployment requirements, community support, and personal preference.

## Installation
To get started with PyTorch, you'll first need to install it on your system. You can install PyTorch using pip or conda, depending on your preference and system configuration. Follow the instructions on the official [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/) to install PyTorch on your system. Personality I prefer [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) most of the time due to lack of computational power of my system.
